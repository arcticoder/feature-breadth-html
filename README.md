# feature-breadth-html
Improve your knowledge of HTML markup language feature breadth by release version

See <a href="https://github.com/arcticoder/feature-breadth-php">feature-breadth-php</a> or <a href="https://github.com/arcticoder/feature-breadth-ecmascript">feature-breadth-ecmascript</a> for similar projects with other languages, including examples. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to use jQuery for examples requiring javascript interaction, so that the focus remains on the html markup and not on design patterns or client-side frameworks.
